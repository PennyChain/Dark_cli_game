# scene_roulette(# You wake up with something over your head, and the breathing and worrying of another guy.
# The guy takes of both of the rags of your heads, theres a table in between you two.
# he lays down a revolver and a single bullet. He wants you two to play russian roulette, the winner wins his life back.
# If you dont play, he will torture you and kill you.(Her bruker du "random" biblioteket der det er en 1/6 sjangse for å dø for begge hver tur..))
